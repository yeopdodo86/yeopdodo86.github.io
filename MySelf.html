          <h2>Personality</h2>
              <p class="box">Even though I am not an active person, I think I am getting along with people well. Thay might be becuase I am a good listener and care for others. I think that I am a kind of person who thinks first then speak. I think that I am a hardworking person because I worked hard in every place I have worked.

        <p>
          <h2>Hobby</h2>
        <p class="box">  I like coding at first. Creating own things makes me happy. A computer is one of my old best friend since I was 6 years old. When my parents went out for work, I enjoyed playing with a computer.
          I also like to meet poeple. I have some friends whom I meet regularly.
          I like to learn something new. That's why I spend lots of time to read books and articles.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h2>Goal</h2>
          <p class="box">
          There are many goals that I want to acheive. My short-term goal is having a secure job. It couldn't be better if I could do what I love and satisfy financial needs while I am working.
          My long term goal is having harmonious family. I want to be a good father for children and a good husband for my wife. It could be the one of the toughest missions, but family is really important. That's why I set it as my long-term goal.
